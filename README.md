# DonarsChoose Project Funding Predictions

## Problem 
Public schools often face large disparities in funding, which results in teachers and staff members utilizing their personal funds to purchase classroom supplies. DonorsChoose is an online crowdfunding platform that exists so educators can seek funding for projects and resources from the community. These projects will be able to reduce the financial burden teachers take on so their students have good education. However, projects on DonorsChoose expire after 4 months, and if the target funding level is not reached, the project receives no funding. If these projects are not getting funded, those students affected will nto be able to learn as effectively because of the lack of resources. We are hoping these kinds of projects will be prioritized so they will be able to be fully funded before they eventualyl expire on DonorsChoose
